## üîß Trading Configuration

### Wallet Allocation Rules
- **Safe Mode (< $320)**: 70% for loans, 30% for gas
- **High-Risk Mode (‚â• $320)**: 80% for loans, 20% for gas

### Supported DEXs
1. **QuickSwap** - 0.3% fee + 1.5% gas margin
2. **SushiSwap** - 0.3% fee + 1.5% gas margin  
3. **Balancer** - 0.05% fee + 1.5% gas margin
4. **Aave** - 0.3% fee + 1.2% gas margin

### Token Pairs Monitored
- WMATIC/USDC
- WMATIC/USDT
- WMATIC/DAI
- WMATIC/WBTC
- WMATIC/WETH
- USDC/USDT
- And more cross-pairs...

## üéõÔ∏è Dashboard Features

### Real-Time Monitoring
- ‚úÖ Live wallet balance (MATIC)
- ‚úÖ Current trading mode (Safe/High-Risk)
- ‚úÖ Scan counter and opportunities found
- ‚úÖ Total trades executed and profits
- ‚úÖ Audio alerts for trades

### Controls
- üöÄ **START** - Begin continuous scanning
- ‚èπÔ∏è **STOP** - Halt all operations
- üìä **Performance Chart** - Profit over time
- üì± **QR Codes** - Quick TX verification

### Audio System
- üîä **Continuous Tap** - Active scanning
- ‚úÖ **Success Ping** - Profitable trade executed
- ‚ùå **Failure Buzz** - Trade failed or error

## ‚ö° Automation Logic

### 1. Continuous Scanning
```python
# Scans 1140+ token pairs across 7 DEXs
# Detects price inefficiencies in real-time
# Calculates profit after fees and gas
```

### 2. Dynamic Spread Validation
```python
required_spread = loan_fee_rate + gas_margin
if actual_spread >= required_spread and net_profit > 0:
    execute_trade()
```

### 3. Flash Loan Execution
```python
# Calculate maximum loan amount
loan_budget = wallet_balance * allocation_percentage
borrow_amount = loan_budget / fee_rate

# Execute arbitrage:
# 1. Borrow Token A via flash loan
# 2. Swap A ‚Üí B on DEX 1
# 3. Swap B ‚Üí A on DEX 2  
# 4. Repay loan + fee
# 5. Keep profit
```

### 4. Auto-Reinvestment
- Successful trades increase available capital
- Mode automatically switches at $320 threshold
- Continuous compounding of profits
